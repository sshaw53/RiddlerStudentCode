| Aug 22 | 11:35am-12:03pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I worked through challenges #1-3 on paper and was able to successfully determine the encryption scheme. |
| Aug 24 |   2:15-2:45pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I began to code the encryptions for #1-3 and started to relearn Java coding. |
| Aug 24 |   5:45-6:15pm   |                                                                                                                    I finished the coding encryptions for #1-3 but my tester file won't run so I tried to debug that and failed, and I also tried to find out what the encryption scheme was for #4 but failed to succeed. |
| Aug 25 |   5:45-6:10pm   | Again failed to succeed on finding the encryption scheme for #4. I thought that it would relate to the ASCII value of each symbol but even then I can't find the pattern going on from there (I looked at the last 3-digit number of the value, tried to see if there was just a shift, added the numbers together, etc.) |
| Aug 28 |  10:00-10:30am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Finally got my tester file to work and debugged my issues on #1-3. |
| Aug 28 |    6-6:45pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Improved my efficiency for my solution for #1 per the classroom discussion. Also solved #4. |
